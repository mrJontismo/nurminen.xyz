	    <h2>My homelab</h2>
	    <p>This page is dedicated to my homelab. This is where I do all the learning by running services and doing experiments.</p>

	    <h3>Details</h3>
	    <p>The two lenovo PCs on the left of the rack run debian. I use them to learn about stuff like docker and ansible.</p>
	    <p>The HP workstation on the bottom runs Windows Server 2022 and I use it to learn about Active Directory, Windows Deployment Services and the like.</p>
	    <p>The HP Microserver on the right is my firewall/router which runs OPNsense. The Pi on top runs Pi-hole.</p>
	    <p>There is a Cisco Catalyst 2960-X, a TP-Link 1Gbps managed switch and a patch panel on top of the rack. I use the OPNsense box and the switches together to learn about network administration.</p>
	    <p>Last but not least is the HP workstation on the right, which runs OpenBSD. It actually hosts this website.</p>
	    <p>All of this gear I've gotten for free from my past/current workplace. The switch, rack and Pi I paid for myself.</p>
